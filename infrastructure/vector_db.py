        "SentenceTransformers is a Python framework for state-of-the-art sentence, text and image embeddings. You can use this framework to compute sentence / text embeddings for more than 100 languages. These embeddings can then be compared e.g. with cosine-similarity to find sentences with a similar meaning. This can be useful for semantic textual similar, semantic search, or paraphrase mining.",
